The main change is moving registry key cleanup logic for context menu shell extensions (ImageResizer, FileLocksmith, PowerRename, NewPlus) from static installer definitions to new custom uninstall actions, ensuring more reliable removal and future extensibility.\n\n**Installer and Uninstall Refactoring**\n\n* Added new custom actions (`CleanImageResizerRuntimeRegistryCA`, `CleanFileLocksmithRuntimeRegistryCA`, `CleanPowerRenameRuntimeRegistryCA`, `CleanNewPlusRuntimeRegistryCA`) to programmatically clean up registry keys for each shell extension during uninstall, implemented in `CustomAction.cpp` and exported in `CustomAction.def`.
