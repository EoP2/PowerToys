## Telemetry Prologue
 * Before starting your tests, go to General settings, enable "Diagnostic data" and "Enable viewing" and restart PowerToys.

## Telemetry Epilogue
 * After finishing your tests, go to General settings, press Diagnostic data viewer and check if you have xml files for the utilities you've tested and if it looks like the events in those xml files were generated by the actions you did with the utilities you've tested.

## [Install tests](tests-checklist-template-installer-section.md)
 * install a **previous version** on a clean machine (a clean machine doesn't have the `%localappdata%\Microsoft\PowerToys` folder)
 * open the Settings and for each module change at least one option
 * open the FancyZones editor and create two custom layouts:
    * a canvas layout with 2 zones, use unicode chars in the layout's name
    * one from grid template using 4 zones and splitting one zone
    * apply the custom canvas layout to the primary desktop
    * create a virtual desktop and apply the custom grid layout
    * if you have a second monitor apply different templates layouts for the primary desktop and for the second virtual desktop
 * install the new version (it will uninstall the old version and install the new version)
 - [ ] verify the settings are preserved and FancyZones configuration is still the same
 - [ ] test installing as SYSTEM (LocalSystem account)
   * Remove current PowerToys.
   * Download PsTools from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec
   * Run PowerToys installer with psexec tool `psexec.exe -sid <path_to_installer_exe`
   * Brief check if all modules are working

 * PER-USER and PER-MACHINE TESTS:
   * Install **previous version** on a clean machine and update with new per-machine version. Ensure that it is installed in Program files and that registry entries are under **HKLM**/Software/Classes/PowerToys. Go trhough different modules and ensure that they are working correctly.
   * Try installing per-user version over already installed per-machine version and ensure that proper error message is shown.
   * Remove PowerToys and install per-user version. Ensure that it is installed in <APPDATA>/Local/PowerToys and that registry entries are under **HKCU**/Software/Classes/PowerToys. Go trhough different modules and ensure that they are working correctly.
   * Create a new user and install per-user version there as well. Go trhough different modules and ensure that they are working correctly. Ensure that changing settings for one user does not change settings of other user.

## Functional tests

## Localization

 - [X] System tray menu items
 - [X] Settings
 - [X] OOBE (What's new)
 - [X] Keyboard Manager Editor
 - [X] Color Picker (check the tooltips)
 - [X] FancyZones Editor
 - [X] Power Rename (new WinUI 3 may not be localized)
 - [X] PowerToys Run ("Start typing" string is localized, for example)

## Hosts File Editor
 * Launch Host File Editor:
   - [X] Verify the application exits if "Quit" is clicked on the initial warning.
   - [X] Launch Host File Editor again and click "Accept". The module should not close. Open the hosts file (`%WinDir%\System32\Drivers\Etc`) in a text editor that auto-refreshes so you can see the changes applied by the editor in real time. (VSCode is an editor like this, for example)
   - [X] Enable and disable lines and verify they are applied to the file.
   - [X] Add a new entry and verify it's applied.
   - [X] Add manually an entry with more than 9 hosts in hosts file (Windows limitation) and verify it is split correctly on loading and the info bar is shown.
   - [X] Try to filter for lines and verify you can find them.
   - [X] Click the "Open hosts file" button and verify it opens in your default editor. (likely Notepad)
 * Test the different settings and verify they are applied:
   - [X] Launch as Administrator.
   - [X] Show a warning at startup.
   - [X] Additional lines position.

## File Locksmith
 * Start the PowerToys installer executable and let it stay in the initial screen.

   - [X] End the tasks in File Locksmith UI and verify that closes the installer.
   - [X] Start the installer executable again and press the Refresh button in File Locksmith UI. It should find new processes using the files.
   - [X] Close the installer window and verify the processes are delisted from the File Locksmith UI. Close the window
 * Start the PowerToys installer executable again and let it stay in the initial screen.
   - [X] Right click the directory where the executable is located, select "What's using this file?" and verify it shows up. 
   - [X] Right click the drive where the executable is located, select "What's using this file?" and verify it shows up. You can close the PowerToys installer now.
 * Restart PowerToys as admin.
   - [X] Right click "Program Files", select "What's using this file?" and verify "PowerToys.exe" doesn't show up.
   - [X] Press the File Locksmith "Restart as an administrator" button and verify "PowerToys.exe" shows up.
 - [X] Right-click the drive where Windows is installed, select "What's using this file?" and scroll down and up, verify File Locksmith doesn't crash with all those entries being shown. Repeat after clicking the File Locksmith "Restart as an administrator" button.
 - [X] Disable File Locksmith in Settings and verify the context menu entry no longer appears.

## GPO

   - [X] Open the "Local Group Policy Editor" on Windows and verify there is a "Microsoft PowerToys" folder in Administrative Templates for both Computer Configuration and User Configuration.
 * In GPO, disable a module that can run as a standalone (FancyZones sounds good for this). Restart PowerToys.
   - [X] Verify the module is not enabled.
   - [X] Open settings and verify the module is not enabled and you can't enable it.
   - [X] Try to open FancyZones Editor directly from the install folder and verify it doesn't run and adds a message to the log saying it didn't run because of GPO.
   - [X] Verify the module can't be launched from the quick launcher system tray flyout launcher screen (FancyZones editor in this case).
   - [X] Verify the module can't be enabled/disabled from the quick launcher system tray flyout.

   - [X] Open settings and verify the module is not enabled and you can't enable it.
   - [X] Try to open File Locksmith directly from the install folder and verify it doesn't run and adds a message to the log saying it didn't run because of GPO.
