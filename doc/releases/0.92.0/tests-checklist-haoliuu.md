## Telemetry Prologue
 * Before starting your tests, go to General settings, enable "Diagnostic data" and "Enable viewing" and restart PowerToys.

## Telemetry Epilogue
 * After finishing your tests, go to General settings, press Diagnostic data viewer and check if you have xml files for the utilities you've tested and if it looks like the events in those xml files were generated by the actions you did with the utilities you've tested.

## [Keyboard Manager](tests-checklist-template-keyboard-manager-section.md)

UI Validation:

  - [ ] In Remap keys, add and remove rows to validate those buttons. While the blank rows are present, pressing the OK button should result in a warning dialog that some mappings are invalid.
  - [ ] Using only the Type buttons, for both the remap windows, try adding keys/shortcuts in all the columns. The right-side column in both windows should accept both keys and shortcuts, while the left-side column will accept only keys or only shortcuts for Remap keys and Remap shortcuts respectively. Validate that the Hold Enter and Esc accessibility features work as expected.
  - [ ] Using the drop downs try to add key to key, key to shortcut, shortcut to key and shortcut to shortcut remapping and ensure that you are able to select remapping both by using mouse and by keyboard navigation.
  - [ ] Validate that remapping can be saved by pressing the OK button and re-opening the windows loads existing remapping.

Remapping Validation:

For all the remapping below, try pressing and releasing the remapped key/shortcut and pressing and holding it. Try different behaviors like releasing the modifier key before the action key and vice versa.
  - [ ] Test key to key remapping
    - A->B
    - Ctrl->A
    - A->Ctrl
    - Win->B (make sure Start menu doesn't appear accidentally)
    - B->Win (make sure Start menu doesn't appear accidentally)
    - A->Disable
    - Win->Disable
  - [ ] Test key to shortcut remapping
    - A->Ctrl+V
    - B->Win+A
  - [ ] Test shortcut to shortcut remapping
    - Ctrl+A->Ctrl+V
    - Win+A->Ctrl+V
    - Ctrl+V->Win+A
    - Win+A->Win+F
  - [ ] Test shortcut to key remapping
    - Ctrl+A->B
    - Ctrl+A->Win
    - Win+A->B
  * Test app-specific remaps
    - [ ] Similar remaps to above with Edge (entered as `msedge`), VSCode (entered as `code`) and cmd (entered as `windowsterminal`). For cmd try admin and non-admin (requires PT to run as admin)
    - [ ] Try some cases where focus is lost due to the shortcut. Example remapping to Alt+Tab or Alt+F4
  - [ ] Test switching between remapping while holding down modifiers - Eg. Ctrl+D->Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E->Ctrl+V, hold Ctrl and press D followed by E. Should select all and paste over it in a text editor. Similar steps for Windows key shortcuts.

## Quick Accent
 * Enable Quick Accent and open notepad. Then:
   - [x] Press `a` and the left or right arrow and verify the accent menu appears and adds the accented letter you've selected. Use left and arrow keys to cycle through the options.
   - [x] Press `a` and the space key and verify the accent menu appears and adds the accented letter you've selected. Use <kbd>Space</kbd> to navigate forward, <kbd>Space</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> to navigate backward.
   - [x] Disable Quick Accent and verify you can no longer add accented characters through Quick Accent.
 * Test the different settings and verify they are applied:
   - [x] Activation key
   - [x] Language (for example, Currency has no accents for 'a' but has for 's')
   - [x] Toolbar position (test every option, some had issues before)
   - [x] Input delay
   - [x] Exclude some apps. Verify that Quick Accent is not activated for them.
   - [x] Sort characters by frequency.
   - [x] Always start on the first character when using left/right arrows as activation method.

## [Install tests](tests-checklist-template-installer-section.md)
 * install a **previous version** on a clean machine (a clean machine doesn't have the `%localappdata%\Microsoft\PowerToys` folder)
 * open the Settings and for each module change at least one option
 * open the FancyZones editor and create two custom layouts:
    * a canvas layout with 2 zones, use unicode chars in the layout's name
    * one from grid template using 4 zones and splitting one zone
    * apply the custom canvas layout to the primary desktop
    * create a virtual desktop and apply the custom grid layout
    * if you have a second monitor apply different templates layouts for the primary desktop and for the second virtual desktop
 * install the new version (it will uninstall the old version and install the new version)
 - [ ] verify the settings are preserved and FancyZones configuration is still the same
 - [ ] test installing as SYSTEM (LocalSystem account)
   * Remove current PowerToys.
   * Download PsTools from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec
   * Run PowerToys installer with psexec tool `psexec.exe -sid <path_to_installer_exe`
   * Brief check if all modules are working

 * PER-USER and PER-MACHINE TESTS:
   * Install **previous version** on a clean machine and update with new per-machine version. Ensure that it is installed in Program files and that registry entries are under **HKLM**/Software/Classes/PowerToys. Go trhough different modules and ensure that they are working correctly.
   * Try installing per-user version over already installed per-machine version and ensure that proper error message is shown.
   * Remove PowerToys and install per-user version. Ensure that it is installed in <APPDATA>/Local/PowerToys and that registry entries are under **HKCU**/Software/Classes/PowerToys. Go trhough different modules and ensure that they are working correctly.
   * Create a new user and install per-user version there as well. Go trhough different modules and ensure that they are working correctly. Ensure that changing settings for one user does not change settings of other user.

## Environment Variables
 * NOTE: Make backup of USER and SYSTEM Path and TMP variables before testing so you can revert those is something goes wrong!
 * Open Environment Variables settings
   - [ ] Launch as administrator ON - Launch Environment Variables and confirm that SYSTEM variables ARE editable and Add variable button is enabled
   - [ ] Launch as administrator OFF - Launch Environment Variables and confirm that SYSTEM variables ARE NOT editable and Add variable button is disabled

 * User/System variables
   - [ ] Add new User variable. Open OS Environment variables window and confirm that added variable is there. Also, confirm that it's added to "Applied variables" list.
   - [ ] Edit one User variable. Open OS Environment variables window and confirm that variable is changed. Also, confirm that change is applied to "Applied variables" list.
   - [ ] Remove one User variable. Open OS Environment variables window and confirm that variable is removed. Also, confirm that variable is removed from "Applied variables" list.
   - Repeat the steps for System variables.

 * Profiles - Basic tests
   - [ ] Add new profile with no variables and name it "Test_profile_1" (referenced below by name)
   - [ ] Edit "Test_profile_1": Add one new variable to profile e.g. name: "profile_1_variable_1" value: "profile_1_value_1"
   - [ ] Add new profile "Test_profile_2": From "Add profile dialog" add two new variables (profile_2_variable_1:profile_2_value_1 and profile_2_variable_2:profile_2_value_2). Set profile to enabled and click Save. Open OS Environment variables window and confirm that all variables from the profile are applied correctly. Also, confirm that "Applied variables" list contains all variables from the profile.
   - [ ] Apply "Test_profile_1" while "Test_profile_2" is still aplpied. Open OS Environment variables window and confirm that all variables from Test_profile_2 are unapplied and that all variables from Test_profile_1 are applied. Also, confirm that state of "Applied variables" list is updated correctly.
   - [ ] Unapply applied profile. Open OS Environment variables window and confirm that all variables from the profile are unapplied correctly. Also, confirm that "Applied variables" list does not contain variables from the profile.

 * Overriding existing variable
   - [ ] To "Test_profile_1" add one existing variable from USER variables, e.g. TMP. After adding, change it's value to e.g "test_TMP" (or manually add variable named TMP with value test_TMP).
   - [ ] Apply "Test_profile_1". Open OS Environment variables window and confirm that TMP variable in USER variables has value "test_TMP". Confirm that there is backup variable "TMP_PowerToys_Test_profile_1" with original value of TMP var. Also, confirm that "Applied variables" list is updated correctly - there is TMP profile variable, and backup User variable..
   - [ ] Unapply "Test_profile_1". Open OS Environment variables window and confirm that TMP variable in USER variable has original value and that there is no backup variable. Also, confirm that "Applied variables" list is updated correctly.

 * PATH variable
   - [ ] In "Applied variables" list confirm that PATH variable is shown properly: value of USER Path concatenated to the end of SYSTEM Path.
   - [ ] To "Test_profile_1" add variable named PATH with value "path1;path2;path3" and click Save. Confirm that PATH variable in profile is shown as list (list of 3 values and not as path1;path2;path3).
   - [ ] Edit PATH variable from "Test_profile_1". Try different options from ... menu (Delete, Move up, Move down, etc...). Click Save.
   - [ ] Apply "Test_profile_1". Open OS Environment variables window and confirm that profile is applied correctly - Path value and backup variable. Also, in "Applied variables" list check that Path variable has correct value: value of profile PATH concatenated to the end of SYSTEM Path.

 * Loading profiles on startup
   - [ ] Close the app and reopen it. Confirm that the state of the app is the same as before closing.

 - [ ] "Test_profile_1" should still be applied (if not apply it). Delete "Test_profile_1". Confirm that profile is unapplied (both in OS Environment variables window and "Applied variables" list).
 - [ ] Delete "Test_profile_2". Check profiles.json file and confirm that both profiles are gone.
