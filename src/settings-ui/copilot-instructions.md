# Settings UI â€“ Copilot guide (short)

Scope
- WinUI/WPF app for configuring modules; communicates with Runner over named pipes.

Build
- Build from `src/settings-ui/Settings.UI**` first.

Specific Guideline
- Avoid breaking settings schema; handle migrations gracefully.
- If you changed IPC/JSON contracts, verify the implementation at `src/runner/**` for consistency.
- Keep UI responsive; marshal to UI thread explicitly.

Docs to consult
- `doc/devdocs/core/settings/readme.md`, `doc/devdocs/core/settings/*.md`
